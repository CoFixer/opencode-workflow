## EXTRACTION RULES

### 1. Design System Extraction

**From Design Guide, extract:**

| Design Guide Section | AURA Field | Transformation |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| `Project Name` (header) | `project_name` | Direct copy |
| `Page Count: N Total Pages` | `total_pages` | Extract number N |
| `Design Philosophy` → Inspiration | `style` | Convert to style description |
| `Colors` → Primary | `primary_color` | Extract hex code |
| `Colors` → Success/Warning/Error | Color palette | Map to success/warning/error |
| `Typography` → Font | `font` | Extract font family |
| `Typography` → Sizes | Typography section | Map H1-H4, Body, Small |
| `Spacing` → Base | Spacing section | Extract grid system |
| `Key Components` | Styling section | Extract radius, shadows |

**Example Transformation:**
```
Design Guide:
"Primary Blue: #0066FF"

AURA Output:
primary_color: "#0066FF"
```

### 2. Page Extraction

**From Design Guide Page-by-Page section:**

| Design Guide Format | AURA Format | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| `PAGE 1: Landing Page` | `## Page: 01-landing` | Convert to slug |
| `PAGE 7: Dashboard Home` | `## Page: 07-dashboard` | Use page number from Design Guide |
| `Sections: Header \| Hero \| ...` | LAYOUT INSTRUCTIONS | Expand each section |
| Guest/User/Admin label | `category:` | Map to auth/user/admin/public |

**Category Mapping:**
- "Guest Users" pages → `category: public`
- "Logged In Users" pages → `category: user`
- "Admin" pages → `category: admin`
- Login/Signup/Forgot Password → `category: auth`

### 3. Layout Conversion

**Design Guide Format:**
```
**PAGE 2: Login**
Split screen 40/60: Left (brand gradient) | Right (form: email, password, social buttons)
```

**AURA Format:**
```
**OVERALL LAYOUT:**
- Split screen: 40% branding panel (left), 60% form panel (right)
- Branding panel: Gradient background using primary color
- Form panel: White background, centered content

**BRANDING PANEL (Left 40%):**

- Heading: "Sign In" (H2 size from Design System: 36px)
- Fields: Email input, Password input (48px height from Design System)
- Button: Primary button (full-width)
```

**Conversion Rules:**
1. **Add measurements**: "Split screen 40/60" → "40% left, 60% right"
2. **Reference Design System**: "form" → "48px height inputs per Design System"
3. **Expand abbreviations**: "social buttons" → "Google OAuth button, Apple OAuth button"
4. **Add styling**: "gradient bg" → "Linear gradient using primary (#0066FF)"

### 4. Component Pattern Integration

**Design Guide has component patterns:**
```
**Upvote Button (Product Hunt style):**
- Large arrow (32px)
- Vote count (24px bold)

```

**Use in page layouts:**
```

- Primary color when voted for visual feedback
```

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before generating, verify Design Guide contains:
- [ ] Project name and page count
- [ ] Design System section (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Design Philosophy (inspiration references)
- [ ] Page-by-Page Design Brief for all pages
- [ ] Component Patterns (reusable components)
- [ ] Critical Design Rules

---

## TIPS FOR GOOD OUTPUT

1. **Extract exact values**: Use Design Guide's px values, hex codes, don't invent
2. **Reference Component Patterns**: Link to defined patterns instead of recreating
3. **Apply Design Philosophy**: Integrate inspiration (Product Hunt, Reddit, etc.) into relevant pages
4. **Use Design System**: Reference typography sizes, spacing values, colors from Design System
5. **Expand abbreviations**: "Split screen 40/60" → detailed layout with measurements
6. **Add states**: Loading, error, empty, hover from Design Tips
7. **Include responsive**: Desktop-first notes, mobile adaptations
8. **Main Actions table**: Critical for defining interactivity
9. **Be specific**: "form" → "email input (48px height), password input with toggle"
10. **Page separator `---`**: Required for AURA parsing

---

## USAGE

```bash
/design-guide-to-aura-prompts /path/to/design-guide.md
```

**Output:** Single markdown file with AURA-compatible prompts for all pages
**Location:** `.project/design/[ProjectName]_AURAPrompts_[YYMMDD].md`

---

## ERROR HANDLING

- **File not found**: Verify Design Guide path
- **Missing Design System**: Cannot generate without colors/typography
- **Missing page count**: Cannot validate completeness
- **Unclear page descriptions**: Add to questions section, generate best effort
