# Notion Ticket Reviewer

Automatically fetch, analyze, fix, and update tickets from the Project Ticket Notion database using OpenCode.

---

## Overview

This skill enables OpenCode to:
1. **Fetch tickets** from the Project Ticket Notion database
2. **Filter** by status, priority, category, app, sprint, or project
3. **Analyze requirements** from ticket descriptions
4. **Implement fixes** in the codebase automatically
5. **Update ticket status** to "In Progress" → "Ready for test"
6. **Add comments** with implementation details

---

## Quick Start

### Review All Tickets
```
Review notion tickets
```

### Review New Tickets Only
```
Review notion tickets with status New
```

### Fix a Single Ticket
```
Fix ticket: <ticket title>
```
or
```
Fix ticket: <page-id>
```

### Filter by App
```
Review notion tickets
Filter: App = "APP", Status = "New"
```

### Filter by Sprint
```
Review notion tickets
Filter: Sprint = "Sprint 3"
```

## Database Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Database ID** | `ba90177d-58a7-443f-8a59-87c589e48f58` |
| **Database Name** | Project Ticket |
| **Workspace** | Potential Inc |
| **API Key Location** | `backend/.env` → `NOTION_API_KEY` |

## Workflow: One-by-One Ticket Fixing

### Step 1: List Tickets
```
Review notion tickets
```
- Shows all "New" tickets
- Grouped by category (Bug, New Feature, etc.)
- Displays: Priority, App, Sprint, Feature, Title, Ticket ID

### Step 2: Select & Start Ticket
```
Fix ticket: [ticket title or ID]
```
- Sets status to **"In Progress"**
- Analyzes ticket requirements
- Explores relevant codebase files

### Step 3: Implement
OpenCode will:
- Read relevant files based on ticket description and feature
- Make necessary code changes
- Follow project coding standards
- Run tests if applicable

### Step 4: Complete
After implementation:
- Sets status to **"Ready for test"**
- Adds Dev's Comment with:
  - Files modified
  - Changes made
  - Testing notes
- Optionally creates git commit

### Step 5: Next Ticket
```
Fix next ticket
```
or select another ticket by name/ID

## API Reference

### Query Database

## Prerequisites

### 1. Notion API Key
1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Create new integration
3. Copy the Internal Integration Secret (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`)

### 2. Add to .env File
Add your API key to `backend/.env`:
```
NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_your_key_here
```

### 3. Share Database
1. Open your Notion database
2. Click "..." → "Add connections"
3. Select your integration

### 4. Test Connection
```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=$(grep -E "^NOTION_API_KEY=" backend/.env | cut -d'=' -f2)
curl -s -X GET "https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "API token is invalid"
1. Check `NOTION_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`
2. Verify key starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`
3. Regenerate key at notion.so/my-integrations if needed

### "Database not found"
1. Database ID: `ba90177d-58a7-443f-8a59-87c589e48f58`
2. Ensure integration has access to the database
3. Re-share database with integration

### "Status update failed"
1. Verify "Status" property exists
2. Check status option names match exactly: Backlog, New, In Progress, Ready for test, Close
3. Ensure property type is "Status" (not "Select")

### Test curl connection
```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=$(grep -E "^NOTION_API_KEY=" backend/.env | cut -d'=' -f2)
curl -s -X GET "https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"
```
