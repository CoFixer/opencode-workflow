# PRD to PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE Converter

Convert a Product Requirements Document (PRD) PDF into structured `.project/docs/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` documentation.

---

## Iteration Behavior

This skill is iteration-aware:

### Iteration 1 (Initial)
- Full extraction from PRD to PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md

### Iteration N (Improvement)
1. **Read both versions**: Current PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md AND updated prd.pdf
2. **Generate diff**: Identify what changed in the PRD
3. **Update incrementally**: Add new sections, modify changed sections
4. **Preserve architecture**: Never overwrite the Architecture Overview section

---

## Purpose

This resource guides the transformation of `prd.pdf` (located in the project root) into structured PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md documentation, providing Claude with product context for development tasks.

---

## When to Use

- Initial project setup from PRD
- After PRD updates to sync documentation
- When PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md needs regeneration
- When asked to "update project knowledge from PRD"

---

## Prerequisites

- `prd.pdf` must exist in the project root directory
- Write access to `.project/docs/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Read the PRD

Use Claude's Read tool to read the PDF:

```
Read ./prd.pdf
```

### Step 2: Extract Information

From the PRD content, extract the following categories:

#### 1. Product Overview
- Application purpose (from document header/intro)
- Target users and their roles

#### 2. User Types
- PATIENT: Description and default sign-up behavior
- COACH: Description and assignment process

#### 3. Core Features by Role

**Common Features (Section 1)**
- Authentication (Login)
- Sign-up process
- Password reset flow

**Patient Features (Section 2)**
- Home Dashboard
- Exercise Module
- Daily Survey
- Chat functionality

**Coach Features (Section 3)**
- Home Dashboard
- My Patients management
- Chat functionality

#### 4. Key Data Entities
Infer from feature inputs/outputs:
- User fields
- Exercise fields
- ExerciseLog fields
- DailySurvey fields
- ZoomMeeting fields
- ChatRoom/ChatMessage fields

#### 5. Business Rules
Collect all "Rules" subsections from the PRD, including:
- Validation rules
- Status transition rules
- Automatic actions
- Conditional behaviors

### Step 3: Read Existing Architecture Section

Read the current PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md to preserve the Architecture Overview section:

```
Read .project/docs/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md
```

Extract and preserve:
- Architecture Overview
- Technology Stack
- Four-Layer Architecture diagram
- Base Classes Pattern
- Project Structure
- Integration Points
- Common Workflows

### Step 4: Generate PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md

Write the complete file to `.project/docs/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` using the template below.

```markdown
# Project Knowledge

## Error Handling

### PDF Not Found

If `prd.pdf` does not exist in the project root:

```
Error: prd.pdf not found in project root.

Please either:
1. Place the PRD PDF at ./prd.pdf
2. Provide the correct path to your PRD file
```

### Incomplete PRD Content

If PRD sections are missing:
1. Generate what is available
2. Mark missing sections with: `<!-- TODO: Section not found in PRD -->`
3. Inform user of incomplete sections

### Architecture Section Not Found

If existing PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md doesn't exist or lacks Architecture section:
1. Use default Architecture template
2. Mark sections that need manual completion
3. Notify user to review and complete technical details

---

## Example Invocations

Users can trigger this with:
- "Update PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md from the PRD"
- "Convert prd.pdf to project knowledge"
- "Regenerate project knowledge from PRD"
- "Sync project documentation with PRD"
